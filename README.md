## Introduction

Air pollution is becoming a concern for many citizens and governmental officials throughout the United States. Several measures are being taken to reduce fuel and other emissions to improve air quality. Along the Wasatch Front in Utah, it is common to see inversions set in, trapping polluted air in the valleys. These inversions are especially prevalent during the winter months. 

The proposed project is to create a web-based geographical information systems (GIS) tool that can help predict air quality in the Utah Valley area. This will allow the user to forecast pollution conditions in the future. The idea for this project comes from a project completed in the Fall 2014 semester at BYU for the Civil Engineering GIS class. The mentioned GIS class project used emission point sources and wind data to estimate the spread of pollutants in the air in Utah County, Utah. The purpose of this project is to add onto the GIS class project idea by including non-point emission sources, live data, and user controls on a web application.
